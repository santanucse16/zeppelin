aboutUs: "Google's services have become synonymous with simple things online. Number of technological innovations and IT industries in which Google is creating new products is enormous. It's hard to get to know all of them, but realistic. This is why people have started to gather in small local groups and share their experience. Later, the following groups have been called Google Developer Groups. GDGs can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch some videos, to large gatherings with demos, tech talks, hackathons and conferences."

 - {title: "", image: "SOCIETY 2020.png", details: "Societal Computing is an integrated innovative interdisciplinary field which provides the techniques, theories, and research methodologies to address real-life societal problems and create technologies that directly impact the society.

The recent times have seen massive latitudinal and longitudinal growth in the reliance of society on the Internet of Things (IoT) based data-driven computation. This gives rise to a number of innovative and challenging management and policy-based societal issues which require new technological innovations.  The issues include platform based products, automated processes to address real-life problems through the use of computation. The primary motivation of the computer scientists in this domain is to make the world understand the global scenario which computation operates in and to create innovative technological solutions from this vantage point.

The possible ways to address such challenges can be through the use of data-driven systems which monitors and responds through the use of Internet of Things to critical changes in the society in the areas like, however not limited to, smart transport management, human-activity monitoring, smart crisis management in challenged network scenarios, smart environment sensing to create awareness in the society, use of social media data to provide deeper insights to the problems at hand. All these systems do not necessarily need to be discrete and may work concurrently to prove actional insights. All these give rise to a smart society which can use the technology based on the insights provided by the systems.

The goal of the International  Workshop on Societal Computing for the Internet of Things & You (SoCIeTY 2020) is to delve into the application of new and innovative technological research towards improving society through the use of computation. The focus is to provide an interdisciplinary platform for researchers to exchange ideas, present their results, share  their thoughts based on their past knowledge,  stimulate  new  research idea , and  foster  collaborations  among  computer  scientists,  engineers,  domain experts,  urban scientists and representatives from Government and NGOs to develop systems for  an effective computation driven society.
